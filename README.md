# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
This project combined multiple personnel files from the Pewlett-Hackard company into a database for the purpose of analyzing retirement information.  The company wants to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.  The goal of the analysis is to help the company manage the 'silver tsunami' of aging employees reaching retirement age.

## Results
In this analysis, I created two .csv files:
### Retiring Titles
The [retiring_titles.csv](Analysis_Projects/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/Data/retiring_titles.csv) table holds the count of retiring employees by current job title.  
- Based on the image below, we can see that the vast majority of retiring staff menbers hold Senior-level job titles.

### Mentorship Eligibility
The [mentorship_eligibility.csv](Analysis_Projects/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv) table holds the names and information of current employees that are eligible for the company's mentorship program.  

Bulleted list with four major points from the two deliverables.  Use images and support where needed.

## Summary
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
